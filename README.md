### Overview
This repository is a personal study log for solving and reviewing coding test problems. Each solution is approached in a unique way, focusing on understanding and improving problem-solving skills across various coding platforms.  

### Purpose:
**Problem-Solving Practice**: Tackle algorithm and data structure problems using C11 to strengthen coding test readiness.  
**Solution Documentation**: Record solutions and thought processes to reflect on progress and identify areas for improvement.  
**Platform-Specific Organization**: Group problems by coding platform (e.g., BAEKJOON, Programmers) for easy access and review.  

### Repository Structure:
**Platform-Based Folders**: Each folder is dedicated to problems from a specific coding test site.  
**Solution Format**: Solutions include problem descriptions, approaches, and key insights gained through each problem.  
**Language**: All solutions are implemented in C11, ensuring compatibility and performance while following modern C standards.
